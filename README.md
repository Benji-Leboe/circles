prototype concept project for a distributed/decentralized self-hosted, privacy oriented social media network.

core tenets of the platform include:
- self-hosting personal data, including photos/posts/etc.
- all personal data including photos, videos, and other user-generated content are fully user-controlled; this includes permissions etc.
- distributed instances; each network of friends can be considered a "circle". circles can intersect depending on each user's level of discoverability and data permissions
- the limits of a user's circle ensures that the content they see is from users in their immediate community or areas of interest
- circles can be a collective of individual friends/family/etc. or can be around certain areas of interest like music and art, with focus on individual artists or certain styles or genres
- users can set their discoverability on a scale from private (except for whitelisted users) to fully public (discoverable through any circles the user is included in)
- users can be a part of multiple circles, allowing for diverse interconnections between social groups
- users can control their feeds to filter or include content from various circles to self-tailor their home feeds on a granular level
- users can create sub-groups of their circles to include/exclude certain users, either on an individual basis or via certain attributes
- focus on user moderation with ability to appeal to designated admins/content moderators for extremely problematic content such as extremist/hate content, revenge porn, gore/death, or otherwise harmful material
- circles focused on NSFW content age-gated and requires admin/mod approval to join; user-generated NSFW content should be tagged as such. other members of a circle may tag content as NSFW; it will be automatically flagged and filtered as such. posters may un-flag their content to prevent potential griefing; if multiple flag/unflag events occur, it will remain tagged as NSFW and will be passed to an admin or moderator to assess
- flags set by mods cannot be modified by users and can only be changed by another mod or an admin. flags set by admins cannot be changed by moderators, and can only be changed by another admin of a circle
- potential (OPT-IN) user juries in cases of friend circles? flagged content or other disputes can be voted on by a group of other users, with either majority or consensus votes required depending on potential content sensitivity
